## Calculator App

This is a responsive calculator app built with React and JavaScript. It supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, and percentage. It also includes memory functions (M+, M-, MRC) and a mode toggle.

When the **Mode** button is clicked, extra functions appear - allowing you to calculate `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, and `log`. After performing a calculation, a **History** button shows up. Clicking it opens a panel that displays all past calculations.

There's also a **Theme** switch to toggle between light and dark mode. The app handles input errors, formats numbers, and evaluates expressions.
